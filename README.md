# Makefiles
A generalized Makefile build system for C projects.

Place these files in the root directory of your C source code.

**NOTE:** The artifacts folder `ART` must be a sub-directory of the root directory

**NOTE:** The root directory containing the `Makefile` does not need to be specified in `DIR`
